#Chronic Learning

At Chronic Learning, we believe that knowledge should be free, and we want to make it easy for anyone who wants to learn or teach something new to do so.

Here you can find a variety of materials in a broad range of topics, freely accessible to everyone.

The ethos of Chronic Learning is that knowledge should be shared, and our licensing allows for sharing and modifying our materials for non-commercial use, so long as they are properly attributed.

Details of the licenses can be found [here](https://chroniclearning.org/contribute).
