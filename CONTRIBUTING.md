## *Tangible* contributions
These contribution categories involve the provision of educational materials in some form. In order to submit materials via any of these routes, please make sure that you are the owner of the material's copyright (if there is one), and that you have the right to grant Chronic Learning permission to make the materials available for general use.

All materials provided through this project will include the proper attribution(s) to the original creator(s), and will be shared using an open-access license. Details about the licenses can be found in the Licensing page, or in the [`licenses/` directory](https://github.com/baileythegreen/Chronic-Learning/tree/master/licenses) in the GitHub repository.

#### Submission of original content
This contribution method is for materials that are not published anywhere else. Fill out our upload request form with your information and details of what you want to contribute, and we'll get in touch with upload instructions!

#### Submission of, or linking to, existing content
This contribution method is for materials that are part of an existing project.
Get in touch with the maintainer(s) of Chronic Learning to discuss whether uploading your materials to your platform, or adding a link from Chronic Learning's site to your own would be more suitable.

#### Submission of components for materials
This contribution method is for graphics or explanations of concepts that you would like to contribute, but that would benefit from the addition of graphics or explanatory text. These will be passed to a pool of contributors to turn them into complete educational materials. To contribute this way, fill out our upload request form with your information and details of what you want to contribute, and we'll get in touch with upload instructions!

#### Join the Content Creation Team
If you want to contribute, but are primarily interested in one aspect of content creation, such as image/graphic design, or maybe you have a real knack for explaining concepts, join the Content Creation Team and focus on what you enjoy doing! You can work on turning components uploaded by others or created by other team members into completed materials. To contribute this way, get in contact with the project maintainer(s) at baileythestudent@gmail.com.

## *Intangible* contributions
These categories of contributions involve other forms of participation in the project. If you would like to contribute via one of these routes, get in touch with the project maintainer(s) at baileythestudent@gmail.com.

#### Serve as a peer reviewer
In order to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and accessability of our educational materials, we need people with relevant expertise to review them. Reviewers might provide feedback on continuity, clarity, accuracy, or accessability (including whether the information is too technical, or whether images/graphics are accessible for colour-vision impaired individuals).

#### Act as a project adviser
We are always looking for ways to improve this project, so if there are ideas you have that could make it easier to use, or increase its usefulness, please let us know!

## *Growth* contributions
If you have an idea for a new topic that Chronic Learning could cover, we would love to hear it! You can let us know by getting in touch with the project maintainer(s) at baileythestudent@gmail.com, or by submitting an issue to the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/baileythegreen/Chronic-Learning).

## *Meta* contributions
If you have suggested changes for the website itself, or notice errors that we should fix, you can let us know by getting in touch with the project maintainer(s) at baileythestudent@gmail.com, or by submitting an issue to the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/baileythegreen/Chronic-Learning).

Depending on the size of the suggested change, we may suggest that you fork the repository, implement the change in a new branch, and submit a pull request once the change has been successfully tested.
