Bailey Harrington is a perpetual student, currently writing up her doctorate in human genetics in Edinburgh.

Before this, she got two degrees in forensic science and another in psychology.

She enjoys programming, which is part of her PhD, and studying computer science, which really isnâ€™t, as well as myriad other hobbies.

Mostly, she reads.
