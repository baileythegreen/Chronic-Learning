# Code of Conduct

Chronic Learning is a repository of open, accessible educational resources for academics and individuals trying to teach or learn something new, so that the learning curve for new ideas is a manageable one.

We value the participation of each member of the Chronic Learning community and want all members, whether users, contributors, or maintainers, to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members in all interactions.

To make clear what is expected, all users, contributors, and maintainers of Chronic Learning are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. It is to the Chronic Learning Project Lead(s) to enforce this code of conduct.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Project Lead(s) may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or blocking them on GitHub and other platforms.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
