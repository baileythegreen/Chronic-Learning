## Chronic Learning â€” sharing knowledge.
Chronic Learning is an open resource for academics and individuals who are trying to teach or learn something new. The content and materials available on this site, are free to use for academic purposes, such as lecture slides or handouts, and other non-commercial uses inline with the <a href"{{ site.baseurl }}/about/licensing">licensing terms</a>, and with proper attribution.

The initiative stems from the belief that knowledge should be free, and from personal experience with the difficulty of finding basic explanations for concepts when stepping into a new field.

Ideas for topics not covered here, new methods for covering topics, or ways to make the site and conent more accessible and inclusive will always be welcome.
